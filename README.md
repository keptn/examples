#### Load Generator for Carts

The following commands will set up a basic load generator for the carts microservice that generates traffic in **all three stages**:

* Keptn 0.7.0, 0.7.1, 0.7.2
  * Basic (Background traffic)
    ```console
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn/examples/release-0.7.2/load-generation/cartsloadgen/deploy/cartsloadgen-base.yaml
    ```
  * More traffic
    ```console
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn/examples/release-0.7.2/load-generation/cartsloadgen/deploy/cartsloadgen-fast.yaml
    ```
  * Faulty item in cart (generates cpu usage)
    ```console
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn/examples/release-0.7.2/load-generation/cartsloadgen/deploy/cartsloadgen-faulty.yaml
    ```
